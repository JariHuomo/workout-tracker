# GymnasticBodies Research Findings
## Research Date: 2025-10-31

---

## Overview
GymnasticBodies is a strength training system created by Christopher Sommer, former US National Gymnastics Team coach. The program emphasizes progressive calisthenics with strict form and systematic progression.

---

## Core Training Philosophy

### Key Principles
1. **Connective Tissue Focus**: Heavy emphasis on strengthening tendons, joints, and connective tissues (which regenerate at ~1/3 the speed of muscles)
2. **Strict Form**: Gymnastic-quality movement standards
3. **Progressive Overload**: Systematic progression through increasingly difficult variations
4. **Patience**: Long-term development (5+ years for mastery)

### Training Components
- **Strength**: Primary focus on building raw strength
- **Mobility/Flexibility**: Always paired with strength work
- **Progressive Difficulty**: 6 exercise progressions per movement pattern

---

## Mastery Template System

### The Foundation Program Structure

#### Mastery Standards
- **Target for Reps**: 5 sets × 15 reps
- **Target for Holds**: 5 sets × 60 seconds
- **Cycle Length**: 12 weeks per progression level
- **Deload Schedule**: Every 4th week (automatic recovery week)

#### Progression Requirements
- **Cannot advance** to next exercise until mastery standard is achieved
- **Mastery Templates** provide roadmap when you can't hit the target
- **Exercise Steps**: 9 intensity steps within each progression
- **Total Progressions**: 6 exercises per movement pattern (except Single Leg Squat = 5)

---

## Training Cycles

### Steady State Cycle (SSC) - 8-12 Weeks
**Philosophy**: Consistency over progression

**Structure**:
- **Weeks 1-4**: Hard effort (overload)
- **Weeks 4-8**: Medium effort (load)
- **Weeks 8-12**: Easier effort (underload)

**Key Rule**: Once you start the cycle, sets/reps/hold times **stay the same** for the entire cycle

**Example**:
- If max hold = 20 seconds
- Train: 5 sets × 12 seconds
- Frequency: 3-4× per week
- Duration: 8 weeks (no changes)

**Progression Timing**: After completing SSC, retest max → start new cycle with harder variation

---

## Set/Rep Methodology

### Typical Training Volume
- **Preferred**: 5 sets over 6 sets
- **Total Time**: ~60 seconds total quality practice (for holds)
- **Rest Between Sets**: 45-90 seconds
- **Weekly Frequency**: 3-4 training days
- **Example**: 5×12sec holds, 3-4× per week, for 8 weeks

### Rep Accumulation Method
- Take 50% of your max hold time for working sets
- Example: 30-second max → 4 sets × 15 seconds = 60 seconds total
- Accumulate approximately 1 minute of total training volume per day

---

## Feedback-Based Auto-Regulation

### Post-Session Rating System
After each training session, rate difficulty:

1. **Very Easy** → Jump forward to step 3, 6, or 9, or advance to next exercise
2. **Easy** → Move forward 1 step or to next exercise
3. **Fine** → Stay on current step
4. **Too Hard** → Move back one step

This creates an adaptive system that responds to individual recovery and progress rates.

## Example Training Progression

### Scapular Shrugs Example
- **Mastery Standard**: 5 sets × 15 reps
- **Real User Timeline**: 7 weeks to achieve mastery
- **Note**: Every 4th week = deload (reduced reps)

### Typical Session Structure (Example)
- **Week 1**: 3 sets × 12 seconds
- **Week 2-3**: Continue same work
- **Week 4**: Deload (reduced volume)
- **Week 5-8**: Continue original work
- **Week 9**: Retest and potentially advance

## Mastery Template Charts

### What We Know
The proprietary mastery templates show:
- Week-by-week progression from low reps → 15 reps
- Specific set × rep schemes for each week
- Built-in deload weeks (every 4th week)
- Progress tracking showing distance from mastery

### Suspected Progression Pattern
Based on references to "1-1-1-1-1 to 15-15-15-15-15":
- Week 1: 1-1-1-1-1 (5 sets × 1 rep)
- Week 2: 2-2-2-2-2 (5 sets × 2 reps)
- Week 3: 3-3-3-3-3 (5 sets × 3 reps)
- Week 4: **DELOAD** (reduced reps)
- Week 5: 4-4-4-4-4 (5 sets × 4 reps)
- ... continues incrementally ...
- Week X: 15-15-15-15-15 (5 sets × 15 reps = MASTERY)

**Note**: Exact progression charts are proprietary and only available through Foundation program purchase.

## Exercise Categorization

### Foundation One Movements
1. **Hollow Body Hold**
2. **Arch Body Hold**
3. **Plank Progressions**
4. **Push-up Progressions**
5. **Hanging Leg Raise**
6. **Single Leg Squat** (5 progressions instead of 6)
7. **Rope Climb** / **Pull-up Progressions**

Each has 6 progressive variations (exercises) from beginner to advanced.

## Important Findings for App Development

### Must-Have Features
1. **Mastery Tracking**: Visual indicator of progress toward 5×15 or 5×60s
2. **Deload Automation**: Auto-schedule deload every 4th week
3. **Progression Locking**: Can't advance until mastery achieved
4. **12-Week Cycles**: Visual cycle tracking
5. **Feedback System**: Post-workout rating to auto-adjust difficulty
6. **Exercise Library**: 6+ progressions per movement pattern
7. **Form Standards**: Video/description of strict form requirements

### Nice-to-Have Features
1. **Steady State Cycles**: Track 8-12 week consistency phases
2. **Rep Calculators**: Auto-calculate 50% max hold times
3. **Total Volume Tracking**: Track accumulated time under tension
4. **Progression History**: Show which exercises mastered and when
5. **Estimated Timeline**: Show projected time to mastery based on current progress

## Key Differences from Typical Calisthenics Programs

| Aspect | GymnasticBodies | Typical Calisthenics |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Progression Speed** | Very slow (months per level) | Faster (weeks per level) |
| **Rep Range** | 5×15 or 5×60s holds | Variable (5-20 reps) |
| **Form Standards** | Gymnastic-strict | Generally less strict |
| **Deload Schedule** | Every 4th week (mandatory) | Optional/as needed |
| **Advancement** | Locked until mastery | More flexible |
| **Timeline** | 5+ years for basics | 1-2 years to advanced |
| **Focus** | Connective tissue + muscle | Primarily muscle |

## Limitations of This Research

### What We Couldn't Access
1. **Exact mastery template charts** (proprietary)
2. **Detailed week-by-week progression schemes** (behind paywall)
3. **Official Foundation program materials** (purchase required)
4. **Complete exercise library** with form standards
5. **Specific deload protocols** (percentage reductions)

### What We Confirmed Exists
1. Mastery templates DO exist in Foundation programs
2. Progression goes from 1 rep → 15 reps in 5 sets
3. 12-week cycles with 4th week deloads are standard
4. Feedback-based auto-regulation system is implemented
5. 6 exercise progressions per movement pattern

---

## Next Steps for App Development

1. **Design reverse-engineered progression templates** (see PROGRESSION_TEMPLATES.md)
2. **Create mastery tracking UI mockups**
3. **Build deload calculation algorithms**
4. **Design exercise progression database structure**
5. **Implement feedback system for auto-regulation**
6. **Create visual progress charts** (1→15 reps visualization)

## Conclusion

GymnasticBodies uses a highly structured, patient approach to bodyweight strength development. The mastery template system with incremental progressions (1-1-1-1-1 → 15-15-15-15-15) is real but proprietary. However, we have enough information about the framework to create a similar system for a workout tracker app.

The key is combining:
- **Fixed mastery standards** (5×15 or 5×60s)
- **Incremental weekly progression** (add 1 rep per week with deloads)
- **Automatic deloads** (every 4th week)
- **Progress locking** (can't advance until mastery)
- **Feedback-based adjustments** (auto-regulation)

This creates a sustainable, injury-resistant progression system suitable for long-term bodyweight training.
