## Deload Calculation Formulas

### Option 1: Percentage-Based
```
Deload Reps = Current Reps × 0.67 (33% reduction)
Deload Reps = Current Reps × 0.60 (40% reduction)
```

### Option 2: Fixed Step-Back
```
Deload Reps = Current Reps - 3
Deload Reps = Previous Week Reps
```

### Option 3: Volume-Based
```
Deload Total Volume = Current Total Volume × 0.70 (30% reduction)
Distribute across 5 sets
```

## Auto-Regulation Rules

### User Feedback System

**After Each Workout, User Rates:**

| Rating | Action | Adjustment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Too Easy (1) | Jump forward | +2 reps OR skip to next progression step |
| Easy (2) | Progress faster | +1 rep next session instead of next week |
| Just Right (3) | Continue plan | Stay on schedule |
| Hard (4) | Slow down | Repeat current week |
| Too Hard (5) | Step back | -1 rep OR return to previous week |

### Automatic Adjustments

**Failed Set Rules:**
- If fail 1 set: Continue, note for next session
- If fail 2+ sets: Reduce reps by 1 for next session
- If fail all sets: Return to previous week's protocol

**Consistent Success:**
- If "Too Easy" for 2 consecutive sessions → auto-advance
- If hitting target reps with 5+ reps in reserve → suggest advancement

## Visual Progress Indicators

### Progress Bar Calculation
```
Progress % = (Current Total Reps / Target Total Reps) × 100
Progress % = (Current Reps × 5 / 75) × 100

Example: Week 7 = 5×6 = 30 reps
Progress = (30 / 75) × 100 = 40%
```

### Milestone Badges
- 25% Complete: Bronze Badge (5 × 4 reps)
- 50% Complete: Silver Badge (5 × 8 reps)
- 75% Complete: Gold Badge (5 × 12 reps)
- 100% Complete: Platinum Badge (5 × 15 reps - MASTERY)

---

## Testing Recommendation

### Initial Assessment (Week 0)
1. **Max Reps Test**: Perform exercise to failure with strict form
2. **Starting Point Calculation**:
   - Take 30-50% of max reps
   - Round down to nearest whole number
   - This becomes Week 1 target

**Example**:
- Max = 10 push-ups
- 40% of 10 = 4 reps
- Start with 5 × 4 reps instead of 5 × 1
